            foods.
            Stay physically active with regular exercise, such as walking, jogging, or strength training, for at least
            30 minutes most days.
            Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and limit sugary or caffeinated beverages.
            Get 7â€“9 hours of quality sleep each night to support recovery and overall well-being.
            Manage stress through mindfulness, relaxation techniques, or hobbies, and maintain regular health check-ups.
