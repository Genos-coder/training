# 📚 JavaScript Function Concepts

This document explains the **structure of functions**, the difference between **function declarations** and **function expressions**, and how to use **arrow functions** in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Function Structure

### 📖 **Function Definition**:

A function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and the body of the function.

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}
```

- **Function Name**: `addNumbers`
- **Parameters**: `a`, `b`
- **Function Body**: Contains the logic (`console.log(a + b)`)

---

### 💻 **Function Body**:

The **function body** is where the logic of the function resides. It is the part inside the `{}`.

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b); // The code inside the function body
}
```

---

### 🧳 **Function Call**:

To call a function, use its name followed by parentheses with the required arguments.

```javascript
addNumbers(1, 2); // Calling the function with arguments 1 and 2
```

---

### 🔄 **Return Statement**:

The `return` statement immediately stops the execution of the function and returns the specified value.

```javascript
function greet() {
  return "done"; // This will end the function's execution and return "done"
  console.log("This will not run"); // This code is not executed
}
```

---

## 🚀 **Function Declarations**

### 🏗️ **Hoisting**:

- **Hoisting** allows function declarations to be called before they are defined in the code.
- This means that functions can be used anywhere in the scope, even before the function definition appears in the code.

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b); // Adds the numbers and logs them
}

addNumbers(1, 2); // This works even before the function is defined in the code
```

---

### 🔄 **Function Declaration Example (Without Return Statement)**:

```javascript
console.log(addNumbers(1, 2)); // Outputs: undefined, because no return statement is provided
```

---

## 📝 **Function Expressions**

### 🔒 **Not Hoisted**:

- **Function expressions** are not hoisted, meaning they are only available after the line where they are defined.
- These functions are often assigned to variables.

```javascript
const factorial = function (n) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result = result * i; // Calculating the factorial
  }
  return result; // Returns the calculated factorial
};

console.log(factorial(4)); // Outputs: 24
```

- Function expressions are **not hoisted**, so they cannot be called before the function expression is assigned.

---

## ➡️ **Arrow Functions**

Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript.

### ⏩ **Single-line Arrow Functions (Implicit Return)**:

If an arrow function contains a single expression, it automatically returns the result of that expression, eliminating the need for the `return` keyword.

```javascript
const addNumbers3 = (a, b) => a + b; // Implicit return, no need for 'return' keyword
```

### 🧮 **Arrow Function Example (Logging Output)**:

```javascript
const addNumbers2 = (a, b) => {
  console.log(a + b); // Logs the sum of a and b
};
```

---

### ⚡ **Summary of Key Concepts**

- **Function Declarations**: Can be called before they appear in code due to hoisting.
- **Function Expressions**: Cannot be called before their declaration and are assigned to variables.
- **Arrow Functions**: Provide a more concise syntax and support implicit returns for single expressions.
